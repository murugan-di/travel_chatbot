What are your travel dates, and do you have a budget in mind for your trip?

Bot: Awesome! With flights included, the total budget for your honeymoon in Dubai would be ‚Çπ50,000 per person, but with the 10% discount for the special occasion, it will be ‚Çπ45,000 per person.

Now, how many nights would you like to stay? I recommend at least 3 nights to explore the city comfortably. Would you like to stick with that?
==================================================
User: yes
Bot: Great! So, we have 3 nights in Dubai from March 19th to March 22nd. 

Now, let's talk about accommodation. Would you prefer a romantic hotel for couples, or are you looking for something more family-friendly?
==================================================
User: romantic hotels
Bot: Perfect choice! For a romantic stay in Dubai, I recommend the following hotels:

1. **Burj Al Arab Jumeirah** - Iconic luxury with stunning views.
2. **Atlantis, The Palm** - A unique experience with an underwater aquarium.

Would you like more information on any of these hotels, or do you have a specific preference?

Now, just a couple more details: 

1. **Visa Requirements**: A visa is required for Dubai, but it can be obtained online easily.
2. **Booking in Advance**: It's best to book at least 3 months in advance to secure the best rates.
